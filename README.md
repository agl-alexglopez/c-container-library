# tree-lib

This repository contains various data structures supported by a no heap splay tree written in C. This library is largely experimental as a byproduct of working with the `pintOS` operating system at Stanford University, but perhaps it can be interesting to others. I chose a Splay Tree as the backing for the set and priority queue for now simply because I find it to be an interesting data structure, but support will be added for real-time ready data structures like a Red-Black Tree Priority Queue in the future.
