# tree-lib

This repository contains various data structures supported by a no heap splay tree written in C. This library is largely experimental as a byproduct of working with the `pintOS` operating system at Stanford University, but perhaps it can be interesting to others. I chose a Splay Tree as the backing for the set and priority queue for now simply because I find it to be an interesting data structure, but support will be added for real-time ready data structures like a Red-Black Tree Priority Queue in the future.

- Read the [Priority Queue Interface](/include/pqueue.h)
- Read the [Double Ended Priority Queue Interface](/include/depqueue.h)
- Read the [Set Interface](/include/set.h)

## Build Instructions

This repository is currently based around GCC, but it may compile with clang toolchains. Here is a starter `CMakeUserPresets.json` file to get you started if your compiler preferences are different than the default.

Using the convenience makefile.

```zsh
make rel
# run tests
make test-rel
# run one of the sample programs
./build/rel/graph -v=19
# update after edits
make
```

Replace `rel` with `deb` to build in debug mode.

Using the default CMake tools.

```zsh
cmake --preset=rel
# update after edits
cmake -S . -B build/
```
